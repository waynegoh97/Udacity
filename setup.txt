[name of venv]/Scripts/activate -> to run the virtual environment

Visual studio code will face an error that does not allow powershell to run scripts.
To prevent that, run as admin powershell, key in the following command:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
Then select Y

Virtual environment will help us to prevent dependency conflicts for different projects
